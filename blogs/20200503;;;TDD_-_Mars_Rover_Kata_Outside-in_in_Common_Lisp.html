<p>This implementation of the <a class="link" href="https://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata" target="_blank">Mars Rover Kata</a> in Common Lisp gives an introduction to the Actor library <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mdbergmann/cl-gserver" target="_blank">cl-gserver</a>.</p>
<p>So the Rover is implemented as an Actor, but the design is test-driven. I.e.: what collaborators do we have there and how are they associated?</p>
<p>We will finally have carved out a 'reporting' facility where the rover reports its state to.</p>
