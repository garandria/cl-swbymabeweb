<p>This time it's the Game of Life in Common Lisp.</p>
<p>Since I've tried out <a class="link" href="https://clojure.org" target="_blank">Clojure</a> (see the episode on <a class="link" href="../blog?title=Game%2Bof%2BLife%2Bwith%2BTDD%2Bin%2BClojure%2Band%2BEmacs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>) I've discovered a whole new world. The world of <a class="link" href="https://common-lisp.net" target="_blank">Common Lisp</a>.<br />It's been around for so long and I really don't know why I haven't looked at this before.</p>
<p>In my attempt to bring TDD closer to developers (to build better designed software with less defects) &nbsp;I've made a TDD session in <a class="link" href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com" target="_blank">Outside-In</a> style with Common Lisp.<br />Outside-In can use a 'classicist' TDD or the 'London Style' TDD where more is done in the red phase of 'red-green-refactor', and also it uses mocking to carve out design.</p>
<p>Certainly you code Common Lisp using the awesome editor <a class="link" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a> using the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/joaotavora/sly" target="_blank">Sly</a>&nbsp;integrated development environment.</p>
<p>Common Lisp geeks will certainly see some deficiencies in my use of the language. So any tipps are welcome.<br />But the purpose is to show that this development style is certainly possible in Common Lisp because in CL it is possible to develop with a short feedback loop.</p>
