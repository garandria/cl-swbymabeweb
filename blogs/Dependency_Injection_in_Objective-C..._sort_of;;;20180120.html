<p>The post will be about Dependency Injection (DI) in Objective-C. DI or the pattern behind it IoC (Inversion of Control) is well known in the Java world. There are quite a few frameworks available like Spring, EJB, Guice, etc.<br /> On Mac I didn't find something like it. So I've implemented a proof of concept.<br /> <br /> The goal was to inject a service class instance into another object, let&rsquo;s say a consumer of that service. Also it should be possible that the service object can be mocked and a different instance of the service be injected for unit testing.<br /> <br /> Let&rsquo;s see, what we need first is some kind of registration facility where we can register classes by name. When an instance of that class is asked for a new instance will be created and it will be returned. Alternatively an instance of a class can be set for a name, then this instance will be returned instead. With this we can set mock objects for unit testing while in production the real class is used.<br /> <br /> This is the &bdquo;DependencyRegistration&ldquo; facility&rsquo;s interface:</p>
<pre class="brush: oc;">@interface DependencyRegistration : NSObject {
    NSMutableDictionary *classRegistrations;
    NSMutableDictionary *objectInstances;
}
+ (DependencyRegistration *)registrator;

- (void)addRegistrationForClass:(Class)aClass withRegName:(NSString *)aRegName;
- (void)removeClassRegistrationForRefName:(NSString *)aRegName;
- (void)clearClassRegistrations;

- (void)addObject:(id)anObject forRegName:(NSString *)aRegName;
- (void)clearObjectForRegName:(NSString *)aRegName;
- (void)clearAllObjects;

- (id)objectForRegName:(NSString *)aRegName;
@end
</pre>
<p><br /> Here are some relevant parts of the implementation:</p>
<pre class="brush: oc;">- (void)addRegistrationForClass:(Class)aClass withRegName:(NSString *)aRegName {
    [classRegistrations setObject:aClass forKey:aRegName];
}

- (void)addObject:(id)anObject forRegName:(NSString *)aRegName {
    [objectInstances setObject:anObject forKey:aRegName];
}

- (id)objectForRegName:(NSString *)aRegName {
    id anObject = [objectInstances objectForKey:aRegName];
    if(!anObject) {
        Class class = [classRegistrations objectForKey:aRegName];
        anObject = [[[class alloc] init] autorelease];
    }
    return anObject;
}
</pre>
<p><br /> This facility is implemented as singleton.<br /> As you can see a class or an instance of a class can be associated with a registration name. the</p>
<pre class="brush: oc;">-objectForRegName:</pre>
<p>method either creates an object from a registered class or uses a class instance if one has been set.<br /> <br /> Now how is this going to be of use? Let&rsquo;s continue. The next thing we need is a service protocol and a service class that implements this protocol:</p>
<pre class="brush: oc;">@protocol MyServiceLocal
- (NSString *)sayHello;
@end
</pre>
<p><br /> The protocol should be placed outside of the service class implementation, in another header file. Something like &bdquo;Services.h&ldquo;.</p>
<pre class="brush: oc;">#import 
@interface MyService : NSObject  {
}
- (NSString *)sayHello;
@end

@implementation MyService
- (id)init {
    return [super init];
}
- (void)finalize {
    [super finalize];
}
- (NSString *)sayHello {
    return @"Hello";
}
@end
</pre>
<p><br /> I&rsquo;ve mixed interface and implementation here which normally is separated in .h and .m files.<br /> Good. We have our service.<br /> Now we create a consumer of that service that get&rsquo;s the service injected.</p>
<pre class="brush: oc;">#import 
@interface MyConsumer : NSObject {
    id myServiceInstance;
}
- (NSString *)letServiceSayHello;
@end

@interface MyConsumer ()
@property (retain, readwrite) id myServiceInstance;
@end

@implementation MyConsumer
@synthesize myServiceInstance;

- (id)init {
    if(self = [super init]) {
        self.myServiceInstance = INJECT(MyServiceRegName);
    }
    return self;
}
- (NSString *)letServiceSayHello {
    NSString *hello = [myServiceInstance sayHello];
    NSLog(@"%@", hello);
    return hello;
}
@end
</pre>
<p><br /> This is the consumer.<br /> The interesting part is the INJECT(MyServiceRegName). Now where does this come from? The INJECT is just a #define. The MyServiceRegName is also a #define which specifies a common name for a service registration. We can add this to the DependencyRegistration class like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: oc;">#define INJECT(REGNAME)     [[DependencyRegistration registrator] objectForRegName:REGNAME]
#define MyServiceRegName     @"MyService"
</pre>
<p><br /> In fact all service registration names could be collected in this class but they could also be someplace else.<br /> The INJECT define does nothing else than get an instance of the DependencyRegistration singleton and call the -objectForRegName: method which will either return an instance from a created Class or an already set object instance.<br /> <br /> The injection does occur here in an initialisation method.<br /> It could actually also do via a setter or init like:</p>
<pre class="brush: oc;">[consumer setMyService:INJECT(MyServiceRegName)];
[[Consumer alloc] initWithService:INJECT(MyServiceRegName)];
</pre>
<p><br /> The way this is implemented either every consumer get&rsquo;s a new instance of the service or all get the same instance depending on whether an instance has been set in the DependencyRegistration object or not.<br /> <br /> Now let&rsquo;s create a unit test to see if it&rsquo;s working:</p>
<pre class="brush: oc;">#import &lt;SenTestingKit/SenTestingKit.h&gt;
#import 
@interface MyConsumerTest : SenTestCase {
    DependencyRegistration *registrator;
}
@end

@implementation MyConsumerTest
- (void)setUp {
    registrator = [DependencyRegistration registrator];
    [registrator addRegistrationForClass:[MyService class] withRegName:MyServiceRegName];
}

- (void)testSayHello {
    MyConsumer *consumer = [[[MyConsumer alloc] init] autorelease];
    STAssertNotNil(consumer, @"");
    NSString *hello = [consumer letServiceSayHello];
    STAssertEquals(hello, @"Hello", @"");
}
@end
</pre>
<p><br /> You will see that it works when you execute this test. Here just a class name is registered which means that a new class instance is created and injected to the consumer.<br /> <br /> There is plenty of space for improvements of this.<br /> In terms of Java what we have here is either an application scope object (when a service instance has been added via -addObject::) or a request scope object (when no service instance has been added and one is created each time) is passed the the caller.<br /> <br /> Well, after all the DependencyRegistration class is not much more than an Abstract Factory for multiple class types.<br /> <br /> <br /> Cheers</p>
