<p>While being in the process of putting my A1000 with Vampire in production I was wondering how I can clone the Compact Flash (CF) card of my Vampireized A600.<br /> <br /> The A600 is nicely set-up, has everything on it that I need. So I&rsquo;d like to clone the CF card and put it into my A1000.<br /> <br /> Certainly the screenmode settings have to be adjusted later, because the A1000 uses a 16:10 22&ldquo; display while the A600 has a 4:3 19&rdquo; display attached. But that should not pose a problem at all.<br /> <br /> It is possible on Linux or Mac to use the <code>dd</code> command to make a backup and restore it on another CF card.<br /> <br /> Here is how to make a backup: <br /><code>sudo dd if=/dev/disk5 of=~/Desktop/amiga.img bs=1m</code><br /> <br /> <code>disk5</code> is the device here. But it may be different for you. Open the harddisk tool on Mac or check with '<code>diskutil list</code>' for your CF card device.<br /> <br /> Finally, when you made the image you restore it on another CF card: <br /> <code>sudo dd if=~/Desktop/amiga.img of=/dev/disk5 bs=1m</code><br /> <br /> And&hellip; hurray, it boots.</p>
