 ;; about ---------------------------------------
 ("mabe_mission_text" .
"<p>I'm a passionate software-developer, programmer and software-designer.</p>

<p>I like writing clean-code. Not only because I believe that clean-code helps the programmers understand the code better, but also does it give value to the business and helps developing features more quickly.</p>

<p>I like good software-design and I strive to know more and do better. That means I follow and apply the principles of SOLID and various software patterns and hexagonal/clean-architecture. I try thinking of the bigger picture of the software, looking at it from a higher-level.</p>

<p>I do practice the discipline of test-driven development (TDD). It is part of my daily job since ca. 2014 and must say that I wouldn't want to do serious development without TDD anymore.<br/>
Why? Because it is a superior technique to reduce software defects as much as possible.
Also does it help with designing testable, separated and decoupled code.</p>

<p>I like agile software-development. As clean as possible. Extreme-programming in it's original form is mostly true to this.</p>

<p>My experience in software-development ranges from simple bash scripts to large business applications with web UIs in the cloud with cluster and failover features.</p>

<p>I work extensively on the Java Virtual-Machine. Writing Java code since 2001, and Scala code since 2010. I've also looked at Kotlin, Clojure and other languages running on the JVM.</p>

<p>But I've done large projects on Cocoa on Mac, iOS, Android. Projects in .Net with C# and ASP.Net, C++, C, Python.</p>

<p>As of late I found the world of Common Lisp very intriguing. This web page was re-implemented lately in Common Lisp coming from Apache Wicket.</p>
